The building's gross floor area is 248,400 SF, suggesting a fire alarm system will be required. No specific fire alarm vendors or manufacturers are mentioned on this sheet.\nThe project involves multiple new buildings (Building 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). Given the size of the buildings, fire alarm systems are likely required. No specific vendors or manufacturers are mentioned in the provided document.\nThese documents are for road extension and infrastructure plans. There is no mention of fire alarm systems or related work in the provided documents.\nThe project involves the construction of a new building (Building B). The presence of a proposed fire protection line indicates that a fire alarm system is likely required for the new building. No specific vendors or manufacturers are mentioned.\nThe project requires fire protection measures, including knowledge of fire alarm locations and procedures. The type of fire alarm system (new, existing, modification) is not specified, but fire alarm work is definitely within the scope.\nThe project is for a new 248,400 SF building, Compass Bldg 4.
